//also known as Siniking sort, Exchange sort
//swapping with the next adjacent element if first elem is greater than second elem
//after first pass greatest elem is at end
//In second pass second largest element is from last to second place 
// It's like sorting from last to first
// As for each iteration last elements are sorted, so it doesn't matter if we compare those last sorted elements in j counter
// so to tackle this, we go till j - i, so that we reduce some un necessary comparisions
